# Follina workaround (CVE-2022-30190)

## Description
These two scripts can be used to apply the workaround provided by Microsoft to mitigate the vulnerability CVE-2022-30190 as detailed in the MSRC [blog](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2022/05/30/guidance-for-cve-2022-30190-microsoft-support-diagnostic-tool-vulnerability/) and to restore the workaround, should an official patch be released.

The first script 'FollinaMitigation.ps1' will backup the registry key and then remove it in order to apply the workaround.
The second script 'FollinaImportKey.ps1' will import the registry key that was previously exported.

Additional details can be found [here](https://www.sentrium.co.uk/)

## Usage
To run these scripts locally, start a PowerShell prompt with elevated privileges and simply execute:

`.\FollinaMitigation.ps1`

`.\FollinaImportKey.ps1`
